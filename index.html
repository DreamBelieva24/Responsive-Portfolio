      <p> Greetings! Thank you for visiting my page. I am a math teacher turned 
        developer. It's amazing how similar the two different career paths actually
        are. I worked as a teacher for 9.5 years. I was a virtual teacher for 5 years. 
        Basically, I just made a switch from "math code" to computer code and from 
        students to clients. My experience with teacher collaboration has built very
        strong communication skills and has made me a team player. 
        <br>
        <br>
        As for my personality, I have never seemed to fit in one "box." I am 
        analytical but creative. I work well independently but also enjoy working 
        as a team. I have always been logical and math minded and mix
        it up by being empathetic and understanding as well. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Ultimately, I believe that time is a precious thing which causes me to be
        very efficient and focus on building and keeping relationships. You should
        enjoy what you spend your time on!
